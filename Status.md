simple_XRD.py - how is it now? (2023-01-10)

seems to work fine for cubic symmetries (sc, bcc, fcc) with one element

Things to do (short term):
    [] function "intensity" should not use built in values
    [] function "make_graph" should give nicer titles
    [] add random noise
    [] add bacground
    [] investigate U,V,W values
    [] export to csv
    [] read setup and sample data from external files

For the future (long term):
    [] find Miller indecies based on lattice vectors rather than selection rules
    [] other symmetries
    [] more than one element
